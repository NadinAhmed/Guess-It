# Guess the Word Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Guess the Word Game, a project developed as part of the Udacity Android Development Nanodegree. This Android application is designed to challenge users to guess a word within a specified time limit. The project incorporates key topics such as MVVM architecture, LiveData, timer functionality, ViewModel binding, and vibration feedback.

## Features

1. **MVVM Architecture:**
   - The project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting maintainability.

2. **LiveData:**
   - LiveData is utilized to observe changes in the data and notify relevant components. This ensures that the UI always reflects the most up-to-date information.

3. **Timer Functionality:**
   - The game includes a timer that counts down while the user attempts to guess the word. This adds an element of challenge and excitement to the gameplay.

4. **ViewModel Binding:**
   - ViewModel binding is implemented to establish a connection between the UI and the ViewModel. This facilitates efficient communication and data flow between the different layers of the application.

5. **Vibration Feedback:**
   - Vibration feedback is incorporated to enhance the user experience. The device vibrates in response to specific events, providing subtle but effective feedback during the game.
